## Problem Statement
Comorbid conditions can result in significant challenges during pregnancy, causing harm to both the mother and baby. Early detection of potential complications using AI models based on historical data can help minimize these difficulties by allowing prompt and appropriate interventions to be implemented complications.

## Project Goal
Using a developed machine learning algorithm to predict the risks at the end of the first trimester using the patient's historic data. The main goal is to focus on the five initial objectives. Analyzing and observing to predict the risks during pregnancy.

## Key Findings
1. Though datasets were used for each study for different motives there was similarity in how the data was collected and the types of features used. The most used feature categories were different demographic and obstetric characteristics, maternal factors.
2. Machine Learning  has been used mostly in predicting complications in pregnancy, exploring factors responsible for preterm birth, gestational diabetes, c-section, ideal weight, pre-eclampsia. Also, it was evident that different algorithms gave different accuracy in different scopes.
3. The word cloud modeled from titles and keywords confirm the strong relationships. The highlighted words in the visual representations (slide 26) have more prominence in these studies. Significantly highlighted words in both visualizations include  preterm, delivery, cesarean, factors, gestational and pre-eclampsia and risks.
